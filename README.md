A few months ago, I decided to take a new career direction. Specifically, I am training as a full-stack developer and I am also gaining knowledge in User Experience design, to develop applications that are useful, accessible, and inclusive in the fields of psychology and education. I stand out for having initiative, high doses of motivation and curiosity to learn, and a strong desire to work in a team and become a human resource that brings personal, ethical and professional value to the company that decides to bet on me.
